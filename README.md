# 🗂️ E-Portfolio Assignment (But Make It ✨ Cool ✨)

> 📚 Built for: `PESE-600`  
> 🧠 Tech + Creativity + A dash of comic-book flair = This isn’t your typical school portfolio.
> Check it out it even has videos! Where I narrate a story, few ramblings about Why I love Miyazaki-sensei, my recent favorite movie's review and lot more!

## 🎯 What This Is

An **e-portfolio** made specifically for an academic assignment — but let’s be honest, I couldn’t help adding a little **✨ flair ✨**.  
Instead of a plain layout, I gave it some personality using:

- 🌀 **Three.js** for interactive 3D spice  
- 🎭 A **comic-style theme** for quirky fun  
- 🎬 **GSAP & Lenis** for smooth and snappy animations  
- ⚙️ 100% **vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – no frameworks, just vibes

## 🧪 Tech Stack

| Web | Animation | 3D |
|-----|-----------|----|
| `HTML` | `GSAP` | `Three.js` |
| `CSS` | `Custom scroll effects` | `OrbitControls` |
| `JavaScript` | `Comic transitions` | `3D object manipulation` |

## 🎨 Highlights

- 📄 Fulfilled all academic assignment requirements (*but made it fun*)

- 🌐 Interactive 3D objects rendered using Three.js
- 💥 Comic-book themed UI with playful transitions

## 📝 Why I Made This

While the core goal was to meet the brief for PESE-600, I saw an opportunity to **experiment with 3D and animation** in a traditional setting.  
Think of it as a "serious assignment that took a detour through the multiverse" 🎢

## 🚧 Notes

> This portfolio isn’t meant to be a polished, final representation of me —  
> it’s a creative academic piece made with love and lots of javascript. 😄
>I made it when my end semester exams were going. I had lot on my plate and even more so on ma mind, so I tried a bunch of things, scraped a bunch more, that's why code might be messy🙇‍♂️
> I am always super up for code `readability`, `maintainability` and I understand & apologize if its not upto the mark! But I am too lazy to to clean it up and rewire it now. I mean its not even temporary of temporary portfolio, I just did it for fun so 🙇‍♂️
